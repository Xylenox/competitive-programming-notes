Similar to [[World Finals 2018#D. Gem Island]]. A multiset can be represented as a Young Diagram. If we make a Young Diagram where each row corresponds to a number in the original set, and the number of columns is the multiplicity of that number, then a Young Diagram is valid if for all $i$ the first $i$ rows in the new diagram has more cells than the first $i$ rows of the original diagram.
